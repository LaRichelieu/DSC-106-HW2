        <h2>Overall Sales Trend</h2>

        <div id="Overall" style="width: 1200px; height: 900px; margin-left: 0"></div>
        <div style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 1200px; height: auto; margin-left: 0">
            <p>First we shall look at the overall sales for every product. The above chart show the overall trends of sales for our three main products. We are able to see that sales have been steadily growing until October 2018 (where the red lines are at). After witnessing a steep decline that month, the sales never managed to climb back to the original level and fluctuates around a lower level. Considering the fact that Burger King introduced the Impossible Burger at that October, it is reasonable to believe that the introduction of the new product by our competitor caused such market loss for our company.</p>
