        <h1>McDonald's Sales Report</h1>

        <h2>Overall Sales Trend</h2>

        <div id="Overall" style="width: 1200px; height: 900px; margin-left: 0"></div>
        <div style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 1200px; height: auto; margin-left: 0">
            <p>First we shall look at the overall sales for every product. The above chart show the overall trends of sales for our three main products. We are able to see that sales have been steadily growing until October 2018(where the red lines are at). After witnessing a steep decline that month, the sales never managed to climb back to the original level and fluctuates around a lower level. Considering the fact that Burger King introduced the Impossible Burger at that October, it is reasonable to believe that the introduction of the new product by our competitor caused such market loss for our company. People are probably choosing to go to Burger King because they offer something that we can't offer.</p>
            <p>To prevent furthur sales decline and customer loss, we are going to need countermeasures immediately. A good way of doing so is to introduce our own veggie burger. This will allow the customers to have a substitute good for the Impossible Burger, thus increasing our competitiveness in the fast food market, allowing us to pull back customers.</p>
            <P>From the chart, we can see that the introduction of a new type of burger can impact the sales of all other products. Therefore, if we can bring any creative product(not only burgers) into our menu, we would also be able to create an impact on the total sales. That means we don't need to win Burger King in the area of veggie burger. We can outcome them in desserts, drinks or snacks</P>

        <h2>Regional Sales Trend</h1>
        <div id="RegionalTotal" style="width: 1200px; height: 900px; margin-left: 0"></div>
        <div style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 1200px; height: auto; margin-left: 0">
            <p>Now we split up the data by the region and look at the sales for each region. We are able to catch the steep decline in October 2018. The sales amount of every single region is greatly affected by the appearence of Impossible Burger.</p>
            <p>From the regional data, we are able to estimate the market size of every region. Among the five regions, the North East is probably the largest market since its sales amount is almost always the highest. That indicates we have more potential customers in that region. Based on this, we could determine the priority of our strategy. When we have limited resource, we should be putting our focus on advertising in the larger markets first. New products should be introduced in North East Region before served in other areas.</p>

        <h2>Daily Sales Trend</h2>
        <div id="DailySales" style="width: 1200px; height: 600px; margin-left: 0"></div>
        <div style="min-width: 300px; max-width: 1200px; height: auto; margin-left: 0">
            <p>Now we go down to the days in a week. From the above chart, we can see that the average total sales tends to be lower during the weekends and higher during weekdays. This probably because people would eat fast food to save time during work and would prefer eating at better restuarants when they have spare time.</p>
            <p>We should be making our plan based on this trend. During the weekdays, when there are many customers, in-store advertising could be done. And during the weekends, we could offer discount menus and organize some events to attract more customers to eat at our place.</p>
